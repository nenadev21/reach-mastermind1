# Raise! - A Mastermind Game Clone

Raise! is a fun and challenging game, inspired by the classic code-breaking game, Mastermind. This web app was built during my application process for the UI Engineer cohort of the REACH program at LinkedIn.

The goal of the game is for users to discover the correct sequence of numbers in the fewest tries possible. The secret code includes numbers from 0 to 7 and it can include repeats.

The player, who is the code-breaker, will have up to 10 attempts to try different sequences of numbers and compare them with the secret code. The app provides feedback that aims to help players use their logical thinking to uncover the secret code.

It has a home page with two buttons: one for instructions and one to start the game.

The second page is the game page, where users will use the up and down buttons to select their answers.

## The App's Users

This app was built for users, like my mom, who play games on their mobile devices to keep their minds sharp and be entertained.

The original design of the Mastermind game and the common UI were simplified to facilitate the user experience and understanding of the game's rules.
